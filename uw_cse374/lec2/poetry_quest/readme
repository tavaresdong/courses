I've constructed a puzzle to give you practice using the shell. You'll
need to navigate the file system, run programs, and use I/O
redirection.

The puzzle is this: I've hidden the first few lines of my favorite
poem among the files here. Your task is to discover what these lines
are. There are a few challenges:

     >> Not all the files contain valid data, and you will need to
        determine which files are valid and which are decoys. To do
        this, you can use the sha256sum program. When given a
        filename, sha256sum computes a 256-bit value based on the
        contents of that file (SHA-256 is part of a family of
        cryptographic algorithms developed by the NSA). I have listed
        the SHA-256 values of the valid files in the file called
        validated_sha256.

     >> The content of the files has been encoded in binary. That is,
        each letter has been converted to its standard binary
        represetation (e.g., A -> 010000001). I have provided you with
        a program called "decode" that reads text from stdin and
        converts it from binary to the equivalent ASCII text.

     >> The data was not split among the files in byte-divisible
        chunks (i.e., the binary data in a given file may start and
        end in the middle of a letter), so you will need to combine
        the files in the correct order. Use the timestamps for this
        purpose: the first file has the oldest timestamp, the second
        file has the second oldest timestamp, and so on.

Some hints:

     >> The man page for ls may have useful information

     >> Remember that > redirects stdout to a file, < redirects stdin
        to come from a file, and | connects the stdout of one command
        to the stdin of another
